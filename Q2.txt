Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object (obj):
obj is an object with two properties: name and age.
The name property is a string with the value 'Vignesh'.
The age property is a number with the value 23.

Array (arr):
arr is an array with five elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
These data structures (obj and arr) are commonly used in JavaScript for organizing and manipulating data. Objects are used for key-value pairs, providing a way to represent entities, while arrays are used to store ordered collections of values.
